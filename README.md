# Snippet Generator

## Assumptioins
It is assumed that: 
- when a one creates a snippet which already exists, one intends to replace the existing snippet with a fresh new snippet having the same name
- snippet names are case sensitive

## Technologies
Lombok: I added the lombok library so as to auto-generate getters, setters and constructors.
